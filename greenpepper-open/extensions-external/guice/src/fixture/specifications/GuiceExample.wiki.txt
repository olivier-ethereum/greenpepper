This specification is almost the same specification as the {{Demo Space - PhonBook}} example but we are using [Guice|http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/] to inject singleton instance of the _PhoneBook_ to our fixtures.

h3. Setup Example
The {{contact}} column string value will be converted using the [Self Conversion|http://www.greenpeppersoftware.com/confluence/display/GREENPEPPER/Type+conversion+(JAVA)].

|| setup || phone book |
|| contact ||
| Fred, Flintstone, (123) 456-7890 |
| Barney, Rubble, (123) 321-7666 |
| Great, Gazoo, (123) 989-4455 |

h3. List Of Example
We list all _PhoneBookEntry_ found in the _PhoneBook_ in the same order as it was added to the list.

|| list of || phone book ||
|| First Name || Last Name || Number ||
| Fred | Flintstone | (123) 456-7890 |
| Barney | Rubble | (123) 321-7666 |
| Great | Gazoo | (123) 989-4455 |

h3. Do With Example

|| do with || phone book ||

We verify the contact information of {{Fred Flintstone}}.
| check | that number of | Fred | | Flintstone | is | (123) 456-7890 |

We update the phone number of {{Fred Flintstone}}.
| accept | update number of | Fred | | Flintstone | to | (123) 567-8904 |

We verify that the update of the phone number of {{Fred Flintstone}} is correct.
| check | that number of | Fred | | Flintstone | is | (123) 567-8904 |

We verify that {{Wilma Flinstone}} is not already in the list of contact.
| check | that number of | Wilma | | Flintstone | is | nothing |

We try to update the contact {{Wilma Flintstone}} that do not exist (the check confirms that {{Wilma Flintstone}} in not in the list).
| reject | update number of | Wilma | | Flintstone | to | (123) 567-8904 |

We inserts {{Wilma Flintstone}} in the list.
| insert | Wilma | | Flintstone | with number | (123) 567-8904 |

| end |

h3. Subset Of Example
We confirm using the {{subset of}} interpreter that {{Wilma Flintstone}} now belong to our list of contact. This example refer to another fixture class where the _PhoneBook_ instance is injected using Guice (we already have element in the list from the previous actions).

|| subset of || phone book list ||
|| First Name || Last Name || Number ||
| Wilma | Flintstone | (123) 567-8904 |
