<h2>Testing a sequence of actions on a System</h2>

Let's walk through a simple example of a test using a flow style interpreter.

<div>
    <p> First, we need to import the package containing the fixture code for our banking application. </p>

    <p>
        We need to specify the package in which our banking fixture is coded. Once the execution is started,
        GreenPepper searches the fixtures name in the package specified in the import tables.
    </p>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
            <td>import</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>com.greenpepper.samples.application.bank</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<div>
<p>
We want to execute a sequence of actions on the <b>bank</b> fixture. We'll use the <code>DoWithInterpreter</code> for that.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>do with</td>
        <td>bank</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Our first business rule says that a new account should have a balance of 0.00 dollars. <br/>
    We will verify this rule with two actions. The first one opens and account and the second one checks its
    balance. The <b>check</b> keyword - in the first cell of the second row - indicates that we want to check
    the result of the action against the value specified in the last cell.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>open checking account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
        <td>under the name of</td>
        <td>Spongebob</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Squarepants</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>check</td>
        <td>that balance of account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
        <td>is</td>
        <td colspan="2">$0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Savings account should follow the same rule. Let's verify that.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>open savings account</td>
        <td>54321</td>
        <td>under the name of</td>
        <td>Patrick</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Star</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>check</td>
        <td>that balance of account</td>
        <td>54321</td>
        <td>is</td>
        <td colspan="2">$0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Our next rule says that the bank should not take any fee when we deposit money in our account.
    <br/>
    So if we deposit 100 dollars in one of the newly created accounts, we expect the balance to be exactly 100 dollars:
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>deposit</td>
        <td>$100</td>
        <td>in account</td>
        <td colspan="2">12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>check</td>
        <td>that balance of account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
        <td>is</td>
        <td>$100</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    The following rule says that a customer should be able to withdraw funds if the balance of his account is
    sufficient.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>withdraw</td>
        <td>$50</td>
        <td>from account</td>
        <td colspan="2">12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>check</td>
        <td>that balance of account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
        <td>is</td>
        <td>$50</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Nevertheless, checking accounts cannot go overdrawn. If we attempt to withdraw too much money, the bank should
    reject our request.
    <br/>
    Let's try that:
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>reject</td>
        <td>withdraw</td>
        <td>$75</td>
        <td>from account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>check</td>
        <td>that balance of account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
        <td>is</td>
        <td>$50</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Once an account is frozen, we can deposit money in it, but not longer withdraw any money
    from it.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td>freeze account</td>
        <td colspan="4">12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>deposit</td>
        <td>$75</td>
        <td>in account</td>
        <td colspan="2">12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>withdraw</td>
        <td>$25</td>
        <td>from account</td>
        <td colspan="2">12345</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>check</td>
        <td>that balance of account</td>
        <td>12345</td>
        <td>is</td>
        <td>$125</td>
    </tr>
</table>

</div>
